# Freddy's Burgeria

## Objective of the Game
Freddyâ€™s Burgeria is an interactive game which places players in the role of a new recruit at the restaurant. The user must navigate through three stages of making a burger, ingredient-catching, burger making, and cooking the burger. If the user fails any of the three stages, they will be fired from the restaurant. 

## Gameplay Mechanics and User Interaction
The game is designed with a user-friendly structure, ensuring that players receive clear instructions before entering each stage (see example of an instruction page below). These instructions detail the stage's goals and the corresponding key commands required for successful completion. Players use a combination of keyboard keys and mouse controls to play games that challenge their speed, memory, and object manipulation skills.

## Scoring
Players are scored based on their ability to complete the challenges within the stages. In the first and third stages, a ten-second window is provided for users to complete tasks. Failure to complete the challenge within this timeframe prompts the display of a losing screen (see an example of a losing screen below) and causes the game to end. The second stage involves the user being given five seconds to memorize a five-item list, followed up by a task to click on the items in the list in the correct order. Players are allowed three incorrect attempts, however, surpassing this limit results in the game ending with a losing screen. The game is set up so that the user must pass the previous stage before progressing to the next stage. If the user completes all three stages, a winning screen will be displayed.

## Limitations
Once a losing or winning screen is shown, the user must exit and restart the game in order to play the game again.
